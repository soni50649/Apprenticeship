      <h2>My experience</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Workked in HTML, CSS and JavaScript previously</li>
        <li>I have made a game called fun-splitz in which when you click on the screen, different coloured squares (4 specifically) appear on the screen and there is annoying meme music called samovar party on it and the volume starts at full volume and it goes down when you click on the screen and the squares created afterwards.</li>
        <li>I like to deal with logic because that's when the brain is performing at it's best ability because discussions bring out the best logic and sometimes things that you didn't even consider.</li>
      </ul>
